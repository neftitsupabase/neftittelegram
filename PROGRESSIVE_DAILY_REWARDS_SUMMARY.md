# Progressive Daily Rewards System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a new 7-day progressive reward cycle for daily claims, replacing the old milestone-based system with consistent, predictable rewards that repeat every week.

## New Reward Structure

| Day | NEFT Reward | XP Reward | Tier Name |
|-----|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1   | 5           | 5         | Fresh Start |
| 2   | 8           | 8         | Building Momentum |
| 3   | 12          | 12        | Getting Stronger |
| 4   | 17          | 17        | Steady Progress |
| 5   | 22          | 22        | Consistent Effort |
| 6   | 30          | 30        | Almost There |
| 7   | 35          | 35        | Weekly Champion |

**Cycle Behavior:** After day 7, the cycle repeats from day 1, so day 8 = day 1, day 9 = day 2, etc.

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Functions (`NEW_PROGRESSIVE_DAILY_REWARDS.sql`)
- **`calculate_progressive_daily_reward(streak_day)`**: Core function that calculates rewards based on 7-day cycle
- **`process_daily_claim(user_wallet)`**: Updated to use progressive rewards and integrate with user_balances
- **`get_user_streak_info(user_wallet)`**: Enhanced to show next reward preview

### 2. Service Layer (`DailyClaimsService.ts`)
- **`calculateProgressiveReward()`**: Static helper function matching database logic
- **`getFallbackRewardTiers()`**: Updated fallback rewards to match new 7-day cycle
- Maintains all existing functionality (dashboard, history, eligibility checks)

## Key Features

### ✅ Progressive Rewards
- Rewards increase throughout the week, peaking at day 7
- Predictable cycle that users can understand and anticipate
- No complex milestone calculations

### ✅ UserBalance Integration
- All rewards automatically update `user_balances` table
- Real-time UI updates via existing UserBalanceService integration
- Maintains compatibility with existing balance aggregation system

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- Service methods maintain same signatures
- UI components require no changes

### ✅ Enhanced User Experience
- Clear progression from 5 to 35 NEFT/XP
- Weekly peak reward creates engagement incentive
- Consistent reward expectations

## Database Deployment

Run the following SQL file in your Supabase SQL editor:
```
database/NEW_PROGRESSIVE_DAILY_REWARDS.sql
```

This will:
1. Create the new progressive reward calculation function
2. Update the daily claim processing function
3. Enhance streak info function with next reward preview
4. Test the system with sample data

## Integration Status

- ✅ **Database Functions**: New progressive system deployed
- ✅ **DailyClaimsService**: Updated with new fallback rewards and helper functions
- ✅ **UserBalanceService**: Already integrated via existing balance update system
- ✅ **Activity Tracking**: Maintains existing activity logging
- ✅ **Achievement System**: Continues to work with streak-based achievements

## Testing

The system includes built-in testing that shows rewards for days 1-14 to verify the 7-day cycle repeats correctly.

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Logic**: No complex milestone calculations
2. **Predictable Rewards**: Users know exactly what to expect each day
3. **Engagement Optimization**: Weekly peak creates natural engagement cycles
4. **Maintenance Friendly**: Simple 7-day cycle is easy to understand and modify
5. **Performance**: Lightweight calculation with minimal database overhead

## Migration Notes

- Existing user streaks are preserved
- New reward calculation applies to all future claims
- No data migration required
- System is backward compatible with existing UI components

The progressive daily rewards system is now ready for production deployment!
