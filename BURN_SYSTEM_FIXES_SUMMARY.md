# Burn System Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Multiple NFT Distribution Problem** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Users were receiving multiple NFTs instead of one NFT per successful campaign completion.

**Root Cause**: 
- `CampaignEndService` was selecting users who claimed ANY reward during campaigns
- It distributed NFTs to ALL participants based on rarity percentages
- No validation of actual task completion

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `CampaignEndService.ts` to use `getSuccessfulCampaignCompleters()` method
- Only users who completed **ALL tasks** for a project get NFTs
- Exactly **ONE NFT per successful completer** is distributed
- Proper task completion validation using `user_task_completions` table

**Key Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: Get all users who claimed any reward
const { data: participants } = await this.supabase
  .from('campaign_reward_claims')
  .select('wallet_address')

// NEW: Get only users who completed ALL tasks
const { data: completions } = await this.supabase
  .from('user_task_completions')
  .select('wallet_address, task_id')
  .eq('project_id', projectId)
  .eq('completed', true)

// Filter users who completed ALL tasks
const successfulCompleters = Object.entries(userCompletions)
  .filter(([wallet, completedCount]) => completedCount === totalTasks)
  .map(([wallet]) => wallet);
```

### 2. **Quest Progress Bar Logic** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: 
- Required only 1 campaign claim to unlock burning
- Once unlocked, stayed unlocked forever
- No reset mechanism after burning

**Desired Logic**:
- User needs to complete 2 tasks to get 1 burn chance
- After burning, user needs to complete more tasks to get another burn chance

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created new `BurnQuestService.ts` to handle quest progress and burn chances
- Created `user_burn_chances` table to track earned and used burn chances
- Updated Burn page to use new quest service

**Key Features**:
```typescript
// 2 tasks = 1 burn chance
const tasksRequired = 2;
const tasksCompletedSinceLastChance = completedTasks % tasksRequired;
const progressPercentage = (tasksCompletedSinceLastChance / tasksRequired) * 100;

// Burn chance is consumed when user burns NFTs
const burnChanceUsed = await burnQuestService.useBurnChance(walletAddress);
```

## Database Changes

### New Table: `user_burn_chances`
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_burn_chances (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  wallet_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  earned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  used_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NULL,
  source TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (source IN ('task_completion', 'campaign_reward')),
  task_count_required INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 2,
  tasks_completed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

### Database Functions Created:
- `award_burn_chance()` - Awards burn chance when user completes tasks
- `use_burn_chance()` - Consumes burn chance when user burns NFTs
- `get_quest_progress()` - Returns quest progress information

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/services/CampaignEndService.ts`
- ✅ Fixed to distribute only ONE NFT per successful completer
- ✅ Added proper task completion validation
- ✅ Enhanced logging and error handling

### 2. `src/services/BurnQuestService.ts` (NEW)
- ✅ Manages quest progress and burn chances
- ✅ Tracks task completion and burn chance earning
- ✅ Handles burn chance consumption

### 3. `src/pages/Burn.tsx`
- ✅ Updated to use new quest service
- ✅ Quest progress now shows actual task completion
- ✅ Burn chances are consumed when burning NFTs
- ✅ Progress resets after burning (user needs more tasks)

### 4. `burn_chances_migration.sql` (NEW)
- ✅ Complete database migration for burn chances system
- ✅ Includes RLS policies, indexes, and functions

## How It Works Now

### Campaign End Process:
1. Campaign ends
2. System checks `user_task_completions` table
3. Only users who completed ALL tasks get NFTs
4. Each successful completer gets exactly ONE NFT
5. NFTs are distributed by rarity among successful completers only

### Quest Progress System:
1. User completes tasks in campaigns
2. Every 2 tasks completed = 1 burn chance earned
3. Burn chance is stored in `user_burn_chances` table
4. User can burn NFTs only if they have available burn chances
5. After burning, burn chance is consumed (marked as used)
6. User must complete more tasks to earn another burn chance

### UI Behavior (Design Unchanged):
- Quest progress bar shows: `X/2 tasks completed`
- Progress percentage: `(tasks % 2) * 50`
- Burn button disabled until user has burn chances
- After burning, progress resets and user needs more tasks

## Testing the Fixes

### To Test Campaign NFT Distribution:
1. Create a campaign with multiple tasks
2. Have different users complete different numbers of tasks
3. End the campaign
4. Verify only users who completed ALL tasks get exactly ONE NFT

### To Test Quest Progress:
1. User completes 1 task → Progress: 50% (0/2)
2. User completes 2 tasks → Progress: 100% (2/2), burn chance earned
3. User burns NFTs → Burn chance consumed
4. User needs to complete 2 more tasks for another burn chance

## Benefits

### ✅ **Accurate NFT Distribution**
- Only successful completers get NFTs
- One NFT per user per project
- No more multiple NFTs per user

### ✅ **Fair Quest System**
- Users must earn burn chances through task completion
- Burn chances are consumed when used
- Encourages continued participation

### ✅ **Better User Experience**
- Clear progress indication
- Transparent burn chance system
- Fair and balanced mechanics

### ✅ **Maintainable Code**
- Separated concerns with dedicated services
- Proper database structure
- Enhanced logging and error handling

## Migration Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   # Execute the SQL migration
   psql -d your_database -f burn_chances_migration.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Updated Services**:
   - `CampaignEndService.ts` (already fixed)
   - `BurnQuestService.ts` (new service)
   - `Burn.tsx` (updated to use new service)

3. **Test the System**:
   - Create test campaigns
   - Complete tasks
   - Verify NFT distribution
   - Test burn chance system

The design remains exactly the same - only the underlying logic has been fixed to address your specific requirements.
