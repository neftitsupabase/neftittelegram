# Multichain Deployment

NEFTIT NFTs are **not limited to one chain**. Each project that launches a campaign on NEFTIT can **choose its preferred blockchain**.

Supported chains:

* **Polygon**
* **Base**
* **Solana**
* **Sui**
* **Optimism**
* **BNB**
* **Arbitrum**
* **Avalanche**

...and more to come



**How It Works:**

* NEFTIT mints NFTs on the chain selected by the campaign project
* User rewards are deployed accordingly
* NEFTIT handles bridging logic (when applicable) behind the scenes
* Projects don’t need to worry about cross-chain tech we abstract the complexity
* users will get NFTs on project preferred chain

> ✅ Users don’t need to pay mint fees, every NFTs are free
