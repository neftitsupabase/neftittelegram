# Burn-to-Upgrade Mechanism

NEFTIT introduces a dynamic "Burn-to-Upgrade" system that empowers users to transform their earned NFTs into higher-tier collectibles by actively participating in campaigns and engaging with the platform. This feature not only adds a layer of gamification and strategy but also strengthens the long-term value and utility of NFTs within the ecosystem.

#### How the Burn System Works

Users can upgrade their NFTs by burning specific combinations of lower-rarity NFTs. This process is tier-based and requires users to climb through multiple upgrade layers before reaching the ultimate reward.

**Upgrade Tiers:**


1. **Common, Rare, Legendary** → **Platinum**
   * Burn 5 Common NFTs → 1 Platinum NFT
   * Burn 3 Rare NFTs → 1 Platinum NFT
   * Burn 2 Legendary NFTs → 1 Platinum NFT

2. **Platinum → Silver**
   * Burn 5 Platinum NFTs → 1 Silver NFT

3. **Silver → Gold**
   * Burn 5 Silver NFTs → 1 Gold NFT


This hierarchy makes Gold NFTs the rarest and most valuable assets in the NEFTIT ecosystem.

#### Burn Access: Campaign-Based Limit

To ensure fairness and discourage users from simply purchasing large numbers of NFTs from marketplaces and fast-tracking upgrades, NEFTIT introduces a **burn restriction mechanism**:


* **Each completed campaign unlocks 3 burn chances.**

This means users must actively participate in campaigns to earn the right to burn NFTs and progress through upgrade tiers, regardless of how many NFTs they own.



#### Why Burn-to-Upgrade Matters

* **Gamified Progression:** Users build strategy by collecting, timing, and choosing when and how to burn.
* **Reduced NFT Supply:** Burning removes NFTs from circulation, adding scarcity and value to remaining ones.
* **On-Chain Reputation:** Higher-tier NFTs (Platinum, Silver, Gold) can unlock exclusive roles, staking benefits, or governance rights.
* **Fair Ecosystem Growth:** Prevents whales from bypassing engagement by simply buying and upgrading.



#### Final Gold NFTs

Gold NFTs are designed to be ultra-rare and only achievable by:

* Participating in multiple campaigns
* Strategically burning through the tier structure
* Remaining active in the ecosystem

Gold NFTs may come with premium benefits, including access to exclusive airdrops, future governance roles, or high-yield staking opportunities.



**Benefits of Gold NFTs:**

* Highest NEFT point yield
* Governance participation
* Access to premium and gated campaigns
* Future rewards eligibility
* role in Discord + on-platform badges
* some rewards from partnerred projects (not guaranteed)
* Discounts on NEFTIT and other partnered platform
* access to special events, AMAs, and exclusive content.
