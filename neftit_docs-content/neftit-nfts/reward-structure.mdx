# NFT Reward Structure

At the heart of NEFTIT lies a powerful utility-based NFT ecosystem that redefines how Web3 communities earn and engage. NEFTIT NFTs are **not collectibles for hype**, they’re **rewards, identity, and growth assets**.

These NFTs are **earned** (not bought) by participating in meaningful actions, and they unlock a world of engagement, staking, and on-chain progression.



NEFTIT NFTs are distributed to users as **rewards for completing Web3 project campaigns**. These tasks could include social media engagement, joining Discord servers, specific tasks, or supporting project launches.



**Key Features:**

* **Earn NFTs** by completing project campaigns
* NFTs are **airdropped** after each campaign ends
* Each campaign has a **limited time and limited NFT supply** (FCFS based)
* NFTs are **free** (users don’t pay mint price)
* Designed for **utility, staking, and upgrading**
* Can be **traded on marketplaces** or **used within NEFTIT**
