# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** may 1, 2025\
**Last Updated:** may 1, 2025

Welcome to NEFTIT, a decentralized experimental platform that merges the exciting frontiers of NFTs, social gamification, and multichain engagement. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and the NEFTIT platform ("NEFTIT," "we," "our," or "us"). These Terms govern your access to and use of the NEFTIT platform, including its website, decentralized features, NFT offerings, staking systems, campaign engine, user dashboard, smart contract suite, Discord integrations, and any other services offered via neftit.xyz or any of its official subdomains or portals. By accessing or using NEFTIT in any way including browsing the site, connecting a wallet, submitting tasks, referring others, minting or burning NFTs, or interacting with any smart contracts you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as any other relevant policies linked herein, including our Privacy Policy, Risk Disclosure, and Legal Disclaimer.

NEFTIT is currently operated by a decentralized group of contributors. As of the effective date of this document, NEFTIT is not yet a registered legal entity but is in the process of exploring incorporation in a suitable crypto-friendly jurisdiction. These Terms, however, shall apply regardless of the legal status of NEFTIT and shall serve as a binding agreement between you and the project as represented by its contributors, pending further legal formalization.

***

**Eligibility**

To access or use NEFTIT, you must be at least 18 years old or of the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater. By using NEFTIT, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements. NEFTIT is not available to users residing in territories subject to sanctions, embargoes, or restrictions by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the United Nations, or other regulatory authorities, including but not limited to users in North Korea, Iran, Syria, and Crimea. We reserve the right to block or restrict access to users from such jurisdictions or where it would be illegal to offer our services.

***

**Account Registration**

NEFTIT does not require a traditional account setup via username and password. Instead, user access is authenticated through wallet integrations using decentralized protocols such as WalletConnect, MetaMask, Phantom, or other Web3-compatible providers. By connecting your wallet to NEFTIT, you are creating a session-bound identity tied to your wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining accurate metadata (such as social accounts linked for task verification), securing your wallet credentials, and ensuring no unauthorized access occurs through malware, phishing, or negligence. Impersonation, fake identities, the use of throwaway wallets for abuse, or multi-wallet behavior with the intent of manipulating campaigns or evading filters is strictly prohibited and may result in permanent disqualification from the platform.

***

**Blockchain and Wallet Use**

NEFTIT is a non-custodial platform. We do not have access to your wallet’s private keys, seed phrases, or internal balances. All transactions (NFT claims, burns, upgrades, reward drops) occur on-chain via smart contracts and require user signatures. You are solely responsible for securing your wallet and understanding the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions. NEFTIT cannot reverse, refund, or modify any confirmed transaction on Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, or any other supported chain. Gas fees required for transactions are the sole responsibility of the user. NEFTIT may occasionally subsidize gas through promotions or batching mechanisms, but this is not guaranteed.

***

**Referral and Reward System**

NEFTIT’s referral engine is built to reward genuine community growth. By sharing your unique invite link, you may earn NEFT Points, NFT drops, or early access to specific campaigns. However, you must not exploit or game the referral system through automated signups, using multiple wallet addresses, or spamming links across unrelated communities. Such activities are monitored and will result in forfeiture of rewards, possible bans, and removal from whitelists. The reward structure may change over time, and NEFTIT reserves the right to retroactively disqualify entries or freeze referral activity during audits or campaign reviews.

***

**NFT Licensing and Ownership**

NFTs earned or purchased through NEFTIT are bound by specific licensing agreements depending on the campaign, character, or reward type. Unless explicitly stated, NEFTIT NFTs grant you a limited, non-transferable license to display, trade, or utilize the artwork in non-commercial settings. Ownership of the NFT does not grant ownership of the underlying intellectual property, including the character design, branding, animations, lore, or ecosystem mechanics. Commercial usage such as printing, selling merchandise, using the character in games or media must be explicitly licensed through NEFTIT or governed by creative commons provisions if specified. Unauthorized exploitation of NFT artwork or platform content is prohibited and may lead to legal action.

***

**Permitted Use and Conduct**

You agree to use NEFTIT for lawful purposes only. You must not: (a) use the platform in any way that violates applicable local, national, or international laws or regulations; (b) gain or attempt to gain unauthorized access to smart contracts, server infrastructure, internal data, or other users’ wallets; (c) scrape, crawl, or harvest content from NEFTIT for commercial resale, database building, or analytics purposes; (d) use NEFTIT to transmit spam, malware, or malicious links; (e) promote hate speech, violence, or misinformation through campaign tasks or submission descriptions. Violations of these conduct standards may result in permanent bans and legal action.

***

**Content and Intellectual Property**

All materials on the NEFTIT platform including but not limited to the brand name, character designs (e.g., Zylo, Dozi, Kysie), website code, UI/UX layout, campaign modules, whitepaper documentation, reward structure, lore, and any audio-visual content are the intellectual property of NEFTIT and/or its core contributors. Unauthorized copying, redistribution, or reverse-engineering is strictly forbidden. If users contribute content such as memes, user-submitted designs, testimonials, or feedback those contributions may be used for marketing, documentation, or platform enhancement with attribution unless explicitly opted out. NEFTIT respects copyright laws and expects the same from its users.

***

**Account Termination**

NEFTIT reserves the right to suspend or permanently terminate access for users who violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent activities, compromise smart contract integrity, or disrupt campaign fairness. In such cases, previously earned NEFT Points, NFTs, and referrals may be revoked or rendered inaccessible. Termination does not exempt you from prior obligations (e.g., liabilities arising from fraud, IP violation, or abuse). No refunds, compensations, or appeals shall be entertained post-termination unless required by applicable law.

***

**Third-Party Integrations**

NEFTIT interacts with and depends on third-party tools and platforms such as Discord, Twitter (X), Google Analytics, decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS), RPC providers, and wallet SDKs. While we make efforts to ensure seamless integration, NEFTIT is not liable for downtimes, policy changes, content removals, or security breaches from these third-party services. Users must also comply with the terms of those external services and platforms. For example, spamming Twitter tasks may lead to bans from Twitter itself this is outside NEFTIT’s control.

***

**Disclaimers and Assumptions of Risk**

NEFTIT is a beta-stage, experimental platform operating in the cutting-edge sector of decentralized applications and NFTs. It is provided “as is” with no guarantees of uptime, reward distribution, feature permanence, or asset value. The nature of blockchain carries inherent risks including but not limited to smart contract vulnerabilities, gas price volatility, legal scrutiny, wallet breaches, phishing, failed mints, and third-party service breakdowns. NEFTIT does not provide investment advice, legal counsel, or tax guidance. Participation is purely voluntary, and you assume all responsibility for decisions made while using the platform.

***

**Limitation of Liability**

To the fullest extent permitted by law, NEFTIT and its contributors disclaim all liability for damages of any kind direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential arising from use of the platform. This includes but is not limited to lost funds, unreceived rewards, lost access to NFTs or wallet addresses, platform downtimes, or reputational damage. If you are dissatisfied with the platform, your sole remedy is to discontinue use. Our maximum liability under any circumstance shall be limited to the amount (if any) paid directly to NEFTIT for specific services, excluding gas or transaction fees.

***

**Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NEFTIT, its contributors, advisors, moderators, and affiliated partners from any and all claims, liabilities, losses, or expenses arising from your use of the platform, your breach of these Terms, your violation of third-party rights, or your failure to comply with applicable laws. This includes attorney fees and costs related to litigation or out-of-court settlement.

***

**Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which NEFTIT is formally incorporated. Until that time, all disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be resolved through confidential binding arbitration or mutual mediation, unless otherwise required by local law. Users waive any right to participate in class actions and agree that any claim must be brought individually.

***

**Changes to Terms**

NEFTIT reserves the right to update, amend, or revise these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via platform announcements, Discord posts, or email (if provided). Your continued use of the platform after such updates constitutes agreement to the revised Terms. We encourage users to review this page periodically.
