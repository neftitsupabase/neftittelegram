# Legal Information

NEFTIT is an experimental, early-stage decentralized platform operating within the Web3 ecosystem. While our aim is to provide a secure, innovative, and user-focused experience, it is important to acknowledge that the platform is in a developmental phase and subject to continual updates. As such, all users should understand and accept that NEFTIT is provided “as is,” without any warranties of functionality, outcome, or profitability. The platform and its ecosystem involve the use of blockchain technology, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), tokenized rewards, social campaign tasks, and community participation mechanics. By interacting with NEFTIT in any capacity, users accept full responsibility for their actions and associated outcomes, whether technical, financial, or reputational.

Nothing published by NEFTIT, including but not limited to whitepapers, social media communications, campaign pages, NFT information, or community announcements shall be construed as financial advice, investment advice, tax advice, or legal counsel. NEFTIT is not registered as a financial advisor, broker, or asset management entity in any jurisdiction. Any reference to rewards, staking, tokenomics, airdrops, or future token utility is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a promise of future performance. Participation in the NEFTIT platform, including earning or upgrading NFTs, joining campaigns, or holding NEFT points, should not be interpreted as an investment opportunity and does not entitle any user to dividends, profit sharing, ownership rights, or voting rights in any legal corporate structure (unless explicitly introduced through a decentralized governance framework in the future).

As of now, NEFTIT is not registered as a legal entity. The platform operates as a community-driven initiative while actively exploring incorporation in a crypto-forward jurisdiction such as the United Arab Emirates, Singapore or in india. Once incorporated, the project will align with applicable legal and regulatory standards concerning KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), and other compliance frameworks. Until such time, all participation in the NEFTIT ecosystem is to be considered voluntary and at the participant’s discretion. Users should consult with licensed professionals in their jurisdiction before engaging in any blockchain-related activity, particularly if their national laws impose restrictions on token-based systems or decentralized financial platforms.

All original content on the NEFTIT platform including its brand identity, visual assets, NFT artwork, interface design, documentation, and character IP remains the intellectual property of NEFTIT and its core contributors. No part of the content may be copied, redistributed, or adapted without prior written consent. Exceptions may be granted for collaborative and promotional purposes in accordance with agreed partnerships. NEFTIT respects the intellectual property of others and expects all users and partners to do the same.

NEFTIT utilizes and integrates with a variety of third-party services and infrastructures, including but not limited to non-custodial wallets (such as MetaMask, Phantom, and Trust Wallet), social media APIs (such as Twitter and Discord), decentralized file storage, and multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and others. NEFTIT does not hold custody of user wallets, private keys, or seed phrases, nor can it access, reverse, or modify transactions on-chain. Users are solely responsible for managing the security of their wallets, and NEFTIT shall not be liable for any loss of access, token loss, NFT disappearance, or unauthorized activity resulting from negligence or third-party compromise.

All blockchain-based platforms carry inherent risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, wallet security risks, malicious actors, gas fee volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and possible token illiquidity. NEFTIT disclaims all liability for direct or indirect losses arising from user participation. This includes, but is not limited to, phishing attacks, contract bugs, downtime, failed transactions, or misinterpretation of platform materials. The user agrees to hold NEFTIT and its contributors harmless from any and all claims, losses, or liabilities incurred as a result of using the platform.

While NEFTIT strives to maintain a stable, secure, and user-friendly platform, no guarantee is made regarding uninterrupted access or uptime. We reserve the right to suspend, modify, restrict, or remove any functionality, user access, or campaign features at any time and without prior notice. This is particularly relevant during beta phases, audits, high-traffic campaigns, or critical security upgrades. Furthermore, NEFTIT reserves the right to block access from jurisdictions where participation may be illegal or where legal exposure to the platform could arise. Users are expected to confirm their local compliance status before accessing NEFTIT features or interacting with the broader Web3 ecosystem.

User privacy is an important principle of NEFTIT’s design. We do not collect personally identifiable information unless explicitly submitted by the user (e.g., via contact forms or KYC processes, if ever implemented). The platform may, however, track wallet addresses, task performance data, referral activity, and campaign interactions in order to determine reward eligibility, campaign performance, and system optimization. Data is stored on secure infrastructure and is not sold to third parties. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for further details regarding data processing practices.

NEFTIT makes no representations regarding the value of NFTs issued through the platform. These NFTs are utility-based and reward-driven and may or may not be resellable on public marketplaces. In the future, NEFTIT may release a governance or utility token, but this remains a non-binding roadmap item. Tokenomics, supply mechanisms, and utility design are subject to community input, expert review, and legal vetting before launch. Holding NEFTIT NFTs, participating in campaigns, or staking NEFT points does not constitute any right to token airdrops or whitelisting, unless explicitly stated in official campaign communications.

The NEFTIT platform and its core contributors are not liable for damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost data, reputation damage, or opportunity loss, whether arising from user error, third-party integration failures, platform bugs, or force majeure events. The platform is used entirely at the user's discretion, and all risks are assumed by the user. All interactions with the NEFTIT ecosystem are governed by this legal disclaimer, our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and any other future policies as published on our official documentation portals.

This legal page may be updated at any time, with or without notice, in order to reflect platform developments, regulatory changes, or structural updates. By continuing to use the NEFTIT platform, you agree to be bound by the most recent version of this disclaimer and all related policies. We encourage users to check this page regularly for any modifications or updates. For legal questions, takedown requests, or formal concerns, please reach out to our legal contact once published, or via our planned email: **team@neftit.xyz**.

We believe in transparency, user protection, and the ethical development of the Web3 ecosystem. NEFTIT is more than just a platform it's a movement driven by the power of community. We will continue to evolve responsibly, with legal, ethical, and technological integrity at the forefront of everything we build.

As NEFTIT continues to grow, we are actively exploring the creation of a formal legal entity in jurisdictions known for progressive crypto regulation, such as the United Arab Emirates (Dubai), Singapore, or in india. Once incorporated, we will make public our entity name, registration number, and applicable corporate structure. This structure may include a parent company, foundation, or nonprofit organization to support ecosystem development and manage future treasury activities. All user interactions prior to formal incorporation are considered experimental and community-governed in nature, and no individual or contributor should be presumed to represent the platform in a fiduciary or legal capacity unless officially declared.

Looking ahead, NEFTIT may evolve into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where key governance decisions including treasury allocation, feature development, campaign approvals, and protocol updates are voted upon by the community. If and when this transition occurs, NEFTIT may introduce a governance token to facilitate on-chain voting. It is important to note that participation in DAO voting does not grant any form of equity, ownership rights, or guaranteed profit-sharing, nor does it make token holders shareholders in any traditional legal sense. DAO participation remains at the user’s discretion and should be approached with the same risk understanding applicable to any decentralized governance process.

Wherever possible, NEFTIT utilizes open-source software libraries, tools, and smart contract frameworks that are governed by MIT, GPL, or other open-source licenses. While we strive to properly attribute and comply with licensing requirements, we encourage developers and third-party auditors to report any accidental licensing conflicts or violations. NEFTIT’s own original codebase may also be released under an open-source license in the future to foster transparency, community development, and trust. However, access to the codebase does not entitle contributors to official control over the platform unless agreed through community consensus or core contributor approval.

NEFTIT does not currently operate as a custodian of funds, nor do we offer escrow, lending, token bridging, or liquidity pooling services. Any such features, if introduced in the future, will be clearly disclosed along with associated risks, compliance standards, and licensing procedures. Until then, NEFTIT operates purely as a utility-focused campaign platform that issues non-monetary NFT-based rewards. All transactions are conducted directly on-chain, and users are advised to double-check all addresses, smart contracts, and wallet interfaces before engaging with the platform. NEFTIT will never ask for your seed phrase or private key under any circumstances.

Lastly, NEFTIT commits to regulatory cooperation wherever reasonably possible and will respond to lawful takedown requests, abuse reports, or compliance notices issued by recognized authorities. If a legal issue arises in a specific jurisdiction such as user harm, fraud, or data misuse NEFTIT reserves the right to take preventive actions, including blacklisting addresses, pausing smart contract functionality, or disabling platform access temporarily. However, due to our decentralized architecture and reliance on third-party wallets and networks, our ability to enforce such measures is limited. Users are expected to remain ethical, lawful, and respectful of the NEFTIT ecosystem at all times.



## NFT Legal Disclaimer

NEFTIT issues NFTs as part of a community-driven reward and identity system. These NFTs are not intended to be financial instruments, securities, or investment vehicles. Users should not interpret any aspect of the NEFTIT platform, including NFT distribution, staking, or upgrade mechanisms, as financial advice or a promise of monetary gain.

All NFTs issued by NEFTIT are:

* **Free-to-claim** or earned through task-based campaigns, users need to pay a small gas fees to claim it
* Not sold directly by NEFTIT in exchange for money or cryptocurrencies
* Used solely to represent identity, progress, or achievement within the NEFTIT ecosystem
* Designed for community engagement, gamified interaction, and digital recognition

#### Legal Classification

NEFTIT NFTs do not provide any profit rights, dividends, ownership stake, or voting power in any business entity. We do not offer or imply any future financial return through holding, trading, or upgrading NEFTIT NFTs. As such, these NFTs are not securities under most international frameworks (including Howey Test standards in the U.S.).

We actively monitor compliance considerations and reserve the right to update our NFT structure, metadata, or access logic as needed to align with legal guidance.

#### Secondary Market & Transfers

While NFTs may be visible in user wallets or externally tradable on decentralized marketplaces, NEFTIT does not operate or control those platforms. Any third-party transactions involving NEFTIT NFTs are at the sole risk and discretion of the user.

We recommend users refrain from assigning speculative or monetary value to NFTs earned through NEFTIT, especially during the platform's early-stage and experimental development.

#### Final Statement

NEFTIT is a community-focused protocol, and all digital assets earned on the platform are part of an experimental Web3 ecosystem. If legal, tax, or regulatory obligations apply in your jurisdiction, we strongly encourage consulting a qualified professional before participating in any blockchain-related activity.
