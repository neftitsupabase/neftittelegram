# How NEFTIT Avoids Sybil Attacks

NEFTIT uses a combination of **on-chain** and **off-chain** verification tools, as well as behavior analysis and manual reviews, to prevent Sybil and bot-based abuse.

**Anti-Sybil Strategies:**

1. **Wallet Behavior Analysis**
   * Track wallet age, transaction history, and interaction patterns
   * Penalize wallets with zero transaction depth or activity spikes
2. **Social Graph Verification**
   * Check if a wallet is connected to verified Twitter or Discord accounts
   * Look for natural social connections and past history of interaction
3. **IP Rate Limiting & Geo Analysis**
   * Limit number of wallet signups from a single IP or geolocation
   * Flag suspicious behavior such as VPNs or mass wallet creation
4. **Device Fingerprinting**
   * Identify users using the same browser/device to create multiple accounts
5. **Code-Based Access**
   * Special campaign codes and invite-only access prevent mass abuse
   * Codes are redeemable once per verified identity
6. **Referral System Limits**
   * Prevent users from referring themselves via dummy accounts
   * Use wallet linkage and browser storage checks
