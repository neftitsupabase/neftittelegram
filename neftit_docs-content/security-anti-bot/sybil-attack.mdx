# What is a Sybil Attack?

A **Sybil attack** is when a single user creates multiple fake identities (wallets or accounts) to unfairly exploit rewards meant for multiple real users.

In Web3 reward-based ecosystems, this can lead to:

* Fake campaign engagement
* NFT farming by bots
* Unfair distribution of resources
* Damage to project reputation
* Loss of community trust
