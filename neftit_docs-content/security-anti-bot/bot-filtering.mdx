# Bot Filtering in Campaigns

Campaign participation is a major target of bot exploitation. NEFTIT ensures real engagement through multiple bot filtering techniques:



1. **CAPTCHA Protection**
   * Every campaign requires CAPTCHA to block basic bots.
2. **Task Completion Monitoring**
   * Social tasks (like tweeting, Discord join, etc.) are verified via APIs.
   * Cross-checks ensure real-time user interaction.
3. **Time-Based Behavior Monitoring**
   * Bots complete tasks instantly; NEFTIT detects unnatural task speeds.
4. **Duplicate Detection**
   * If the same wallet, device, or IP performs the same campaign multiple times, it's auto-flagged.
5. **Manual Moderator Review**
   * Suspicious accounts are flagged for review by NEFTIT moderators.
