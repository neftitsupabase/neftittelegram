# Real-User Priority Mechanism

We prioritize genuine, active community members in every reward allocation:



1. **Badge & Role Tracking**
   * More badges = higher chance of rare NFTs
   * OG roles and active Discord presence increase trust scores
2. **Engagement History**
   * Long-term engagement increases rarity probability
   * High-trust users are preferred over low-trust or new signups
3. **Tiered Distribution**
   * Some rewards are exclusive to verified, badge-holding users
   * Bots are automatically excluded from high-tier campaigns
4. **Staking Boosts**
   * Only verified wallets can stake NFTs for NEFT points
   * Burn-to-upgrade NFTs only available for real users
