# Key Components of NEFTIT

NEFTIT is not a single-function platform, it’s a **modular ecosystem** designed to **bridge user engagement, NFT-based incentives, campaign mechanics, and decentralized growth loops** across Web3. Each component below plays a distinct role in delivering a seamless, secure, and scalable gamified experience for users, projects, and contributors.

***

### 1. Campaign Engine (Task to NFT Framework)

At the core of NEFTIT is a **campaign engine** that enables Web3 projects to launch social tasks such as follows, reposts, comments, and invites that users can complete to **earn free NFTs** and other on-chain or off-chain rewards.

* Fully customizable campaigns (task type, start/end time, number of winners)
* Campaign specific NFT drop setup with custom NFTs and metadata
* Social media task verification via APIs (Twitter, Discord, Telegram)
* Multi-task structure with checkpoints, boosters, and tiered rewards

***

### 2. NFT Reward Distribution System

NEFTIT leverages NFTs not just as collectibles, but as **identity assets and proof-of-participation units**. Each campaign drops unique NFTs to users based on task performance, rarity logic, and anti-bot validation.

* NEFTIT characters NFTs, new designs per campaign
* Optional metadata linking to task or project milestones
* Stored on decentralised storages with multichain claim logic
* NFTs are upgradeable, burnable, and stakeable in NEFTIT

***

### 3. Burn-to-Upgrade Mechanism

A core gamification layer within NEFTIT is its **burn-to-upgrade engine**, where users can burn low-tier NFTs to receive higher-rarity versions, unlock perks, or improve their NEFT Point yield.

* Encourages long-term engagement and discourages airdrop farming
* Layered upgrade paths linked to wallet score and prior participation
* Deflationary NFT mechanics built into campaign structures

***

### 4. NEFT Points System

NEFT Points are a **non-tokenized loyalty metric** that measure a user’s contribution across campaigns. Points are earned through task completions, referrals, campaign wins, achievements, daily check-ins, staking reward and NFT upgrades.

* Used to unlock exclusive campaigns, rank-based NFTs, or future token access
* Boosted by staking, role/badge ownership, and campaign activity
* Public leaderboard with Sybil-resistance scoring system

***

### 5. Multichain Deployment Architecture

NEFTIT is inherently multichain capable of operating across **Polygon, Base, Solana, sui, and other EVM-compatible chains**.

* Projects choose their preferred chain for NFT deployment
* Users can claim NFTs on-chain, till the claim NFTs will be stored in decentralised storages
* Cross-chain claim bridge under development
* Minimal gas UX using meta-transactions (planned)

***

### 6. Anti-Bot & Sybil Resistance Layer

To ensure reward integrity, NEFTIT is equipped with **multiple fraud-prevention systems**:

* Wallet behavior tracking (time between tasks, duplicate actions)
* IP/device fingerprinting
* Referral system abuse filters
* Flagging logic and penalty system
* Human-centric behavior scoring for real-user prioritization

***

### 7. Referral Engine

NEFTIT includes a **built-in referral layer** to allow users to invite others and earn additional points, rank boosts, or exclusive NFTs.

* Personalized referral links tied to wallet/email
* Leaderboard integration and invite-tracking dashboard
* Protection against fake/multi-wallet referrals
* Used for viral campaign growth and waitlist traction

***

### 8. NFT Identity Characters (Zylo, Kysie, Dozi)

NEFTIT introduces **three mascot-based NFT avatars** with distinct personalities:

* **Zylo**: Represents leadership, alpha status, and first-mover advantage
* **Kysie**: Embodies loyalty, consistency, and community strategy
* **Dozi**: A playful disruptor, linked to surprise rewards and mystery roles

These characters form the basis of rank-based user progression, role systems, and gamified campaigns.

***

### 9. Admin & Project Campaign Dashboard

Projects and internal admins use the **NEFTIT backend dashboard** to:

* Create, edit, launch, and monitor campaigns
* View NFTs data of their campaign
* View analytics like task completion rate, user heatmaps
* Approve/ban flagged wallets or suspicious participants

***

### 10. User Dashboard & Profile System

Every user has access to a **personal dashboard** that shows:

* Referral link and leaderboard rank
* Current and past campaigns
* NFTs claimed and upgrade status
* NEFT Points balance
* Role badge status (Zylo OG, Dozi Holder, etc.)

***

### 11. Analytics & Campaign Reporting

Both project partners and internal teams get access to deep analytics:

* Campaign success metrics (CTR, task drop-off, completion rate)
* User segmentation (new vs returning, device, geo)
* Conversion insights (task to claim ratio, fraud score density)
* Exportable CSVs and public transparency dashboards (in roadmap)

***

### 12. Role-Based Mechanics & Community Engagement

NEFTIT uses **role/badge systems** (like OG, Zylo Rank, Dozi Guardian) to unlock exclusive rewards and campaign access for community contributors.

* Community can earn roles via participation, referrals, contests
* Roles affect NEFT Points, NFT drops, staking power
* Used to drive organic culture-building and identity-based gamification
* Badge holders can access premium or limited access campaigns
* Increase chances to get higher tiered NFT from campaigns

***

### 13. Modular Growth Infrastructure

Everything in NEFTIT is modular: campaigns, NFTs, user flows, reward structures. This enables:

* Permissionless future tools for builders
* Self-serve campaign setup for projects
* Smart contract composability
* Expansion into gaming, DeFi, or creator tools
