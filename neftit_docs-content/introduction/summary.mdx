# Summary

| Problem | NEFTIT Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Projects fail to grow loyal communities | Free NFT task-based campaigns bring real, engaged users for potential projects. |
| High marketing cost, but low-quality users (bots, farmers) | Anti-bot logic, badge-based system, and community moderation |
| No tools designed for Web3 startup growth | All-in-one platform: campaign launchpad + engagement engine + rewards system |
| Web3 users can't easily discover potential projects | Curated multichain project discovery page with OG voting & trust layers |
| NFT hype is fading | NFTs with daily use: staking, burning, upgrading, trading |
| No gamification in Web3 engagement | Task-to-earn, NEFT points, codes, and badge system |
| Users leave after airdrops | Long-term reward system: staking, rarity upgrades, exclusive access |
| Limited to one chain only | NFTs are distributed on any chain projects choose (Polygon, Solana, BNB, Sui, etc.) |
| Web2 users struggle to enter Web3 | Social login, simple UI, and easy onboarding |
| Discord/Twitter campaigns are ineffective | Structured campaigns, measurable results, and rewards for engagement |
| No community governance or decision-making | OG role holders and real ones vote on which projects to feature or partner with |
| Decreasing project trust among users | Community-first, transparent system where only verified campaigns are featured |
