# How Staking Works

1. **Stake-to-Earn**
   * After receiving NFTs through campaigns, users can **stake** them on the NEFTIT platform.
   * Staking duration is flexible (daily system), but longer staking = more points.
   * NEFTIT NFTs and NEFT points both are stakable
2. **Rarity Multiplier**
   * NFT rarities affect how many NEFT Points users earn:
     * Common - 0.1 NEFT/day
     * Rare - 0.4 NEFT/day
     * Legendry - 1 NEFT/day
     * Platinum - 2.5 NEFT/day
     * Silver - 8 NEFT/day
     * Gold - 30 NEFT/day
3. **Dynamic Rate Based on Supply**
   * NEFT point earning rates may **adjust** dynamically depending on how many users stake.
   * Early stakers may earn higher rates as a reward for loyalty.
4. **Staking Pool Cap (Anti-Bot)**
   * To prevent bots and overload, each staking pool has a **cap per rarity** to protect earning value.
