# Anti-Abuse Mechanisms

To protect the value of NEFT Points and prevent exploitation:

* **Verified NFTs Can Be Staked**
  * NFTs earned through legitimate campaigns are allowed in staking contracts.
* **Burn & Cooldown Logic**
  * Users canâ€™t stake-burn-repeat to manipulate point flow.
* **Wallet Reputation System (Coming Soon)**
  * Users with suspicious behavior will have reduced earning or staking rights.
* **Anti-Farming Protections**
  * Our system uses behavior fingerprinting to detect bots, fake referrals, and task repetition
