# Campaign Mechanics for Projects

**Step-by-Step: How Projects Create Campaigns on NEFTIT**



1. **Project Onboarding:**\
   Projects fill out a short form with basic details (name, chain, website, campaign goal, social links, etc.) and get verified.
2. **NFT Design Submission:**\
   Projects either give their info about project on what based their project is or choose to use NEFTIT's design support (optional).
3. **Campaign Setup:**
   * Choose campaign type: (e.g., Twitter engagement, Discord joins, quiz participation, any specific task, riddels etc.)
   * Define task list and completion criteria.
   * Set campaign duration and number of NFTs to be distributed.
4. **Reward Configuration:**
   * Define rarity levels (e.g., Common, Rare, Legendary).
5. **Sybil Protection:**\
   NEFTIT automatically adds bot filtering, wallet behavior analysis, and task verification checks.
6. **Campaign Launch:**\
   Project gets a unique campaign link hosted on NEFTIT. NEFTIT also promotes the campaign within its ecosystem and partner communities.
7. **Live Tracking & Analytics:**\
   Projects get access to a real-time dashboard showing:
   * Task completions
   * NFT claims
   * Chain analytics
   * Flagged/botted attempts
8. **Post-Campaign:**\
   Projects receive data insights, user wallet addresses, and reports for future retargeting or community onboarding.
