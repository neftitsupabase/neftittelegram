# Twitter / Discord Integration

Social media is core to NEFTIT's user journey and platform growth. We've deeply integrated both **Twitter (X)** and **Discord** into our engagement model.



**Twitter Integration:**

* **Follow to Participate:** Almost every campaign starts with a follow task.
* **Tweet Verification:** We verify user posts using hashtags, content detection, and mentions.
* **Repost & Quote Tweet Quests:** Measurable engagement for project visibility.
* **Growth Loops:** Users must tag real friends to spread the reach.
* **Tracking Tools (Planned):** NEFTIT will introduce on-chain/off-chain tracking to verify X engagement for campaign legitimacy.



**Discord Integration:**

* **Role Gating:** Specific campaigns and codes are locked behind Discord roles.
* **Activity-Based Ranking:** Active participation helps users gain higher-level roles.
* **Announcement Hub:** Discord acts as the real-time center for code drops, updates, and secret events.
* **NEFT Points Tracker (Bot):** Discord bot that shows live NEFT Points and ranking (Coming Soon).
* Discord roles holders are able to grab badges in website.
