# Task-to-NFT Pipeline (How It Works)

This is where everything comes together. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the community reward loop:



**1. Join a Campaign:**

* Users join NEFTIT and explore live campaigns.
* Every campaign has a set of simple social/web tasks (e.g., follow, tweet, tag, Discord join, etc.).

**2. Complete Social Tasks:**

* Users perform the tasks.
* NEFTIT verifies tasks via social APIs and bot checks.

**3. Earn NFTs (FCFS or Completion-Based):**

* After the campaign ends, eligible users receive an NFT from the project on their chosen chain.
* NFTs have 3 rarities: **Common, Rare, Legendary** (based on activity, roles, and randomness).

**4. Use or Trade NFTs:**

* Stake NFTs on NEFTIT for NEFT Points
* Burn NFTs to upgrade (e.g., Common → Platinum → Silver → Gold)
* Trade on multichain NFT marketplaces

**5. Keep Participating:**

* As users participate more, they:
  * Earn rare NFTs
  * Gain roles & badges
  * Get early access codes
  * burn more NFTs to get final Gold NFT
  * Boost their NEFT Point rankings
