# Engagement Model: Building a Movement

NEFTIT’s community model is based on **Gamified Engagement** + **Social Incentivization**.



**Key Concepts:**

1. **Task-Driven Incentives**
   * Users complete tasks (e.g., follow, like, tweet, join Discord, personalized task, etc.) to unlock campaign eligibility.
   * Tasks are small but meaningful and easy to perform.
2. **Point & Badge System**
   * Each task rewards NEFT Points.
   * Points lead to ranking, badges, and future rewards chances.
3. **Rarity Boost via Activity**
   * Active users are rewarded with higher chances for **Rare** and **Legendary** NFTs.
   * Passive users mostly receive **Common** NFTs unless randomness grants otherwise.
4. **Tiered Community Roles**
   * Roles like **OG and others** unlock new levels of access, campaigns, and rewards.
   * Earned by consistency and contribution.
5. **NEFTIT special codes**
   * Codes can be redeemed for:
     * NFTs (including limited rarities)
     * Access to hidden campaigns
     * Badges and permanent role upgrades
6. **Mini-Challenges & Events**
   * Time-limited quests (e.g. “Retweet NEFTIT’s post with your thoughts”) with bonus rewards.
   * Keep community buzzing with activity.
