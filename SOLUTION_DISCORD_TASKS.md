# üîç DISCORD TASKS DIAGNOSIS & SOLUTION

## üö® **THE PROBLEM:**

The Discord verification is not working because:

1. **Discord tasks in database are missing configuration:**
   - `action_url` is NULL or empty
   - `discord_guild_id` is NULL or empty  
   - `required_role_id` is NULL or empty

2. **Code falls back to hardcoded values:**
   - `task.action_url || DiscordVerificationService.getDiscordInviteLink()`
   - `task.discord_guild_id || this.DEFAULT_GUILD_ID`

## üîß **THE SOLUTION:**

### **Step 1: Check Current Discord Tasks**
Run this SQL to see what's in the database:
```sql
SELECT 
  pt.title,
  pt.type,
  pt.action_url,
  pt.discord_guild_id,
  pt.required_role_id,
  p.project_name
FROM project_tasks pt
JOIN projects p ON pt.project_id = p.id
WHERE pt.type IN ('discord_join', 'discord_role')
ORDER BY p.project_name;
```

### **Step 2: Fix Discord Tasks Configuration**
For each project, you need to:

1. **Get the project's Discord server invite link**
2. **Get the project's Discord server ID (guild_id)**
3. **Get the project's Discord role ID (if using discord_role tasks)**

### **Step 3: Update Database**
```sql
-- Example: Update a specific project's Discord tasks
UPDATE project_tasks 
SET 
  action_url = 'https://discord.gg/PROJECT_SPECIFIC_INVITE',
  discord_guild_id = 'PROJECT_SPECIFIC_GUILD_ID'
WHERE type = 'discord_join' 
  AND project_id = 'PROJECT_UUID';

UPDATE project_tasks 
SET 
  discord_guild_id = 'PROJECT_SPECIFIC_GUILD_ID',
  required_role_id = 'PROJECT_SPECIFIC_ROLE_ID'
WHERE type = 'discord_role' 
  AND project_id = 'PROJECT_UUID';
```

## üéØ **WHY IT'S NOT WORKING:**

1. **Database has Discord tasks but no configuration**
2. **Frontend code is correct** - it uses `task.action_url` and `task.discord_guild_id`
3. **Fallback to hardcoded values** when database values are NULL
4. **Backend verification fails** because it's checking wrong Discord server

## ‚úÖ **WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:**

1. **Check your database** - see which Discord tasks exist
2. **For each project with Discord tasks:**
   - Get their Discord server invite link
   - Get their Discord server ID
   - Get their Discord role ID (if needed)
3. **Update the database** with the correct values
4. **Test the verification** - it should work with project-specific Discord servers

## üöÄ **RESULT:**

After fixing the database:
- ‚úÖ Discord join tasks will open the correct Discord server
- ‚úÖ Discord verification will check the correct server
- ‚úÖ Each project will have its own Discord configuration
- ‚úÖ No more hardcoded fallbacks

**The code is correct - the database just needs the right configuration!**
