-- ============================================================================
-- FIX ACHIEVEMENT BALANCE AGGREGATION ISSUE
-- The comprehensive_balance_aggregation_system.sql is aggregating from ALL sources
-- This causes wrong values because it includes daily_claims, staking_rewards, etc.
-- For achievements, we should ONLY count claimed achievement rewards
-- ============================================================================

-- PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-- The aggregate_user_rewards_from_all_sources() function aggregates from:
-- 1. campaign_reward_claims (lines 43-57)
-- 2. daily_claims (lines 59-73) 
-- 3. user_achievements (lines 75-92) âœ… This is correct
-- 4. staking_rewards (lines 94-109)
-- 5. staked_tokens (lines 111-122)

-- This means your balance includes MORE than just achievement rewards!

-- Let's check what each source contributes for your wallet:
SELECT 'DEBUGGING BALANCE SOURCES FOR YOUR WALLET:' as debug_header;

-- 1. Check campaign rewards
SELECT 'CAMPAIGN REWARDS:' as source_1;
SELECT 
  COALESCE(SUM(neft_reward), 0) as campaign_neft,
  COALESCE(SUM(xp_reward), 0) as campaign_xp,
  COUNT(*) as campaign_count
FROM campaign_reward_claims 
WHERE wallet_address = '0x5BEdd9F1415B8Eb1F669AAc68B0Fd9106b265071';

-- 2. Check daily claims
SELECT 'DAILY CLAIMS:' as source_2;
SELECT 
  COALESCE(SUM(base_neft_reward + bonus_neft_reward), 0) as daily_neft,
  COALESCE(SUM(base_xp_reward + bonus_xp_reward), 0) as daily_xp,
  COUNT(*) as daily_count
FROM daily_claims 
WHERE wallet_address = '0x5BEdd9F1415B8Eb1F669AAc68B0Fd9106b265071';

-- 3. Check achievement rewards (this should be 1300 NEFT, 650 XP)
SELECT 'ACHIEVEMENT REWARDS (EXPECTED 1300 NEFT, 650 XP):' as source_3;
SELECT 
  COALESCE(SUM(neft_reward), 0) as achievement_neft,
  COALESCE(SUM(xp_reward), 0) as achievement_xp,
  COUNT(*) as achievement_count
FROM user_achievements ua
JOIN achievements_master am ON ua.achievement_key = am.achievement_key

  AND ua.status = 'completed' 
  AND ua.claimed_at IS NOT NULL;

-- 4. Check staking rewards
SELECT 'STAKING REWARDS:' as source_4;
SELECT 
  COALESCE(SUM(reward_amount), 0) as staking_neft,
  COUNT(*) as staking_count
FROM staking_rewards 
WHERE wallet_address = '0x5BEdd9F1415B8Eb1F669AAc68B0Fd9106b265071' 
  AND is_claimed = true;

-- 5. Check staked tokens
SELECT 'STAKED TOKENS:' as source_5;
SELECT 
  COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) as staked_amount,
  COUNT(*) as staked_count
FROM staked_tokens 
WHERE wallet_address = '0x5BEdd9F1415B8Eb1F669AAc68B0Fd9106b265071';

-- TOTAL FROM COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM (what's causing wrong values)
SELECT 'TOTAL FROM COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM:' as comprehensive_total;
SELECT aggregate_user_rewards_from_all_sources('0x5BEdd9F1415B8Eb1F669AAc68B0Fd9106b265071') as comprehensive_result;
