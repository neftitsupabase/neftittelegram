-- Analyze burn chance tracking logic for proper project deduction
-- User has 4 completed projects but should only have 2 remaining after using 2 for burn

-- 1. Check current user burn progress

FROM user_burn_progress

-- 2. Check burn chances earned and used
SELECT 
  'Burn Chances Status' as section,
  wallet_address,
  earned_at,
  used_at,
  project_id,
  CASE WHEN used_at IS NULL THEN 'Available' ELSE 'Used' END as status

-- 5. PROBLEM ANALYSIS: The logic should be:
-- - User completes 4 projects total
-- - Every 2 completed projects = 1 burn chance
-- - User should have earned 2 burn chances (4 projects รท 2 = 2 chances)
-- - If user used 1 burn chance, they should have 1 remaining
-- - Progress should show: remaining_projects/2 where remaining_projects = total_completed - (used_chances * 2)
